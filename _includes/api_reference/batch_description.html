<h2>Closing Batches</h2>
<p>
    All batches are closed automatically every night at 12:00 am EST. If for some reason you want to close a batch manually during the day, this may be done by
    invoking the <code>closeBatch()</code> method. Note that this will NOT prevent the automatic daily batch closure.
