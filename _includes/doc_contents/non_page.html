<h2>Non-Page Specific Requirements</h2>
<h3>General Requirements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Domain: </strong>
        The domain of the merchant website must be registered to the merchant
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Customer Notification of Transaction Results</h3>
<p>
    The customer must have a means to receive notification of the results of a transaction through a separate channel in addition to display on screen. This is
    to ensure that even in the case of an accident such as the customer closing their browser, the customer will still be able to determine if the transaction
    succeeded or failed.
</p>
<p>
    Suggested means of implementing such a feature:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Email Notification: </strong>
        Send an email notification/receipt to the customer, in both success and failure cases. The email should contain the same information as on the receipt.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Self-Serve:</strong>
        Allow the customer to check the status of their transaction through a website or other such system.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
If you do not already have such a feature it is recommended that the Email Notification method be used for ease of implementation.    
</p>
