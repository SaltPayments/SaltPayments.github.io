<h2>Receipts</h2>
<p>
    When a transaction has been completed, you must display a receipt to your customer. The following section describes the requirements of a receipt.
</p>

<h3>What do I need to display in a Receipt?</h3>
<p>
    The required receipt fields listed below include the corresponding CreditCardReceipt field name as returned by SALT (where applicable). Note that there are
    different fields to be displayed depending on if the transaction was successful or unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of a <strong>Successful </strong>Transaction, you must display:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your Merchant Name</li>
  <li>That the transaction was successful? (based on if <code>isApproved() == true</code>)
  </li>
  <li>Invoice Number (<code>getOrderId()</code>)</li>
  <li>
    Amount of the transaction (<code>getApprovalInfo()</code>.<code>getAuthorizedAmount()</code> field, be sure to convert back to dollars/cents
    and also to include currency)
  </li>
  <li>Date of the transaction (<code>getProcessedDateTime()</code>)</li>
  <li>Approval Code (<code>getApprovalInfo().getApprovalCode()</code>)</li>
  <li>
      A button/link allowing the user to print the receipt page
  </li>
  <li>
    Also, optionally:
    <ul>
      <li>Last 4 digits of the Credit Card Number (never display the entire Credit Card number)</li>
      <li>A button/link allowing the customer to return to your home page/account page etc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
    In the case of an <strong>Unsuccessful</strong> Transaction, you must display:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your Merchant Name</li>
  <li>That the transaction was unsuccessful?(based on if <code>isApproved() == false</code>)</li>
  <li>Date of the transaction (<code>getProcessedDateTime()</code>)</li>
  <li>
    About payment retries:
    <ul>
      <li>If you allow the customer to try a different payment option (e.g.INTERAC Online) or to retry Credit Card payment, then indicate to the customer <strong>that they can retry payment </strong>(provide a link to the retry page or display the actual retry options).</li>
      <li>Otherwise display <strong>a clear statement that the order has been cancelled</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Also, optionally: Invoice Number (<code>getOrderId()</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Do NOT display</strong>
    the Approval Code or Card Number to the customer on an Unsuccessful Transaction.
</p>
<h4>Example Receipt/Error Pages</h4>
<p>
    An example of an appropriate receipt for a successful transaction is shown below:
